PyPoll

In this project, our final Python script will need to
be able to deliver the following information when the
script is run:
    1. Total number of votes cast.
    2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
    3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
    4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
    5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Algorithm
    1. Open file with csv reader and iterate over rows.
    2. Store values in a dictionary.
        2.1. Create a new County dictionary per Candidate if it has none.
        2.2. Create a new list per County per Candidate if it has none.
        2.3. If they exist, append Ballot ID to County per Candidate list.
    3. Get candidates names via the dict keys, minus the header row.
    4. Count the number of votes with the length of the Ballot ID list.
    5. Obtain percentages per Candidate using the total votes.
    6. Find the winner Candidate using the percentages.
    7. Print results to console.
    8. Save results to text file.
