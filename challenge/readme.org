* Overview

In this project, we were given the task to find the results of an election by counting the votes in a large dataset. We were also looking for the following data:

1. Total number of votes.
2. List of candidates who received votes.
3. Number of votes per candidate and their percentage.
4. List of counties that had vote turnouts.
5. County with the largest amount of vote turnouts.

We designed an algorithm that would do the work for us by feeding it a csv file and storing the results in a text file.
